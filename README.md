# Machine-Learning-Projects
Class projects implementing different ML techniques. I highlight some of my better ones below.

## ICA.py
Implementation of independent component analysis on 3 sound files to mix them and then separate them. Reconstructed the independent sounds using the ICA algorithm. I've attached a write-up of the project that explains the code and analyzes the results in depth.

## knn.py

Compared the results of using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm alone vs using KNN after dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis to classify the MNIST dataset (loaded using keras/tf). A write-up analyzes the two approahces, concluding slightly higher accuracy without PCA but significantly faster runtimes.

## Backpropagation
